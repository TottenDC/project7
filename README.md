# TechDegree Unit 7 Project - A Static Node.js and Express Site

## Purpose:
* Use Express framework to create a simple server script for a small site (with static and dynamic content).
* Create a portfolio site to showcase your web-based projects.
* Practice templating with Pug.
## Note:
* Pug templates, CSS, and client-side JS provided by Treehouse.
* I customized the Pug templates with my information, created my own error pug template from scratch, changed some of the CSS (button color on hover, sidebar background color, sidebar text color, and anchor colors (on and off hover)), and created the entire app.js file.
